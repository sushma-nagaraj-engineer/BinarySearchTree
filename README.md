# BinarySearchTree

A Binary Serach Tree that implements the following methods:

a)  nodeCount
    Recursively traverses the tree and returns the count of nodes.

b)  isFull 
    Returns true if the tree is full.  A full tree has every node 
      as either a leaf or a parent with two children.

c)  compareStructure 
    Compares the structure of current tree to another tree and returns
      true if they match.

        For example, these two trees have the same structure:
               5           10
              / \         /  \
             3   8       5   15
            / \         / \
           1   4       2   7

d)  equals
    Compares the current tree to another tree and returns true
      if they are identical.

e)  copy
    Creates and returns a new tree that is a copy of the original tree.

f)  mirror
    Creates and returns a new tree that is a mirror image of the original tree.
    For example, for the tree on the left, the tree on the right is returned:

        100                 100
       /   \               /   \
      50   150    -->     150  50
     /                           \
    40                           40
     \                           /
     45                         45

g)  isMirror 
    Returns true if the tree is a mirror of the passed tree.

h)  rotateRight
    Performs a single rotation on the node having the passed value.
    If a RotateRight on 100 is performed:

       100                  50
      /   \                /   \
     50   150    -->      40   100
    /                      \     \
   40                      45    150
    \ 
    45
  
g)  rotateLeft 
    As above but left rotation.

i)  printLevels - performs a level-by-level printing of the tree.

j)  main - demonstrate in your main method that all of your new methods work.
